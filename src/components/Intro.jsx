         Grew up around technology my whole life. I believe to become professional at something. it has to be personal and genuine, but also disciplined in the long run. Not having too many distractions in simplier times allowed me to dive into coding projects, deploying applications, building/reassembling computers, Cloud, and just an overall drive to "do it". Languages learned so far would be: "Java,Javascript,Python,JSON,AWS,CI/CD Pipelines,HTML,CSS,SQL,React,Azure."

          As for now I'm focusing on expanding my demographic on projects, incorporating solutions, and helping start-ups when I can. The beginning stages are the most creative and insightful. A million ideas , but "how to put it all together". That thought process alone satiates the desire to work in this field and continue forward in this journey.
